/**
 * WHAT IS REACT 
 * 
 * React is front-end UI framework, made to simplify the process of building complex sites, in comparison to building the same sites using vanilla html, css, and js.
* React is al about COMPONENTS, because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components.  
* Components are resusable coding blocks for the user interface. Ina finance tracking system, each statement would be a component. 1 piece of code block that can very easily vary the rendered data
*/

/* WHY COMPONENTS
* Reusability 
  - Don't repeat yourself
* Separation of Concerns
  - Keeps our codebase small and mangeable 
  - Don't do too many things in one and the same place
* Maintaing clean, dry code is the craft of programming itself. In every screen and function, we are splitting big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions.
* 
 */

/**
 * HOW IS A COMPONENT BUILT
 * HTML, CSS, JS make up React.
 * 
 * React uses a declarative approach. 
  - It allows us to define the desired end result and use it at will, in coparison to a static site which needs content defined in its place. 
  - Essentially building custom HTML elements
